DATA LINK

Data Link is considered Layer 2 of the OSI Model.

It organises bits from the previous layer, Layer 1 (Physical) into frames. In this context, a Frame is simply a unit of communication.

Layer 2 (Data Link) uses hardware addresses (MAC address) to deliver messages.

Data Link Protocol includes Ethernet, Point-to-Point (PPP) and Medium Access Control (MAC) 

What does that mean?

Data link protocols provide communication between two devices. Logical Link Control (LLC) is a data link protocol of Local Area Network (LAN)
